> **NOTE**: Diagrams and Models have German descriptions

## Course Contents

This process management course focused on Enterprise Content Management (ECM) and included an in-depth exploration of various processes and their relation to ECM, including business and workflow processes. It delved into process design and different techniques for improving existing processes, such as controlling, quality-to-cost, and analytics. The course also covered process modeling, discussing the purpose of modeling elements and languages. Various modeling techniques, such as Petri networks, Event-Driven Process Chains (EPC), and Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN) were explored and examinated based on their structure, behavior, accessibility, and performance for different use cases.

Regarding the practical sessions, we built simulation exercises to better understand workflow management systems. The course provided a historical overview of these systems, detailing the evolution of infrastructure, implementations, and standards. We learned about different process improvement methods and studied real-life examples of successful process improvements in practice.
